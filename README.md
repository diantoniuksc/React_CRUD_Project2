# Setup
To use this demo, you must have a MongoDB Atlas instance. You must create an environment variable, containing the connection string that points to your own particular MongoDB Atlas Cluster. The example below shows what it may look like. Note that the trailing end of this string `mycats` refers to the name of a database. If it doesn't exist yet, that's ok (MongoDB will create it for us automatically).
                                  
```MONGODB=mongodb+srv://<userName>:<password>@cluster0.kto5g.mongodb.net/mycats?retryWrites=true&w=majority```
Change <password> for your password
Change <userName> for your username
